      <b>Definition of success: </b>
      (noun) the accomplishment of an aim or purpose
    </p>

  <p>Below I have listed some successes in approximate chronological order:</p>

  <section>
    <h4>Break the Cycle of Poverty and Self-Destruction</h4>
    <p>
      I vowed early in life to be the exact opposite of my parents.
      I never viewed them as role models. In fact, I viewed them as degenerates.
      Everything about them was a cautionary tale of selfishness, profligacy, addiction, and wreckless impulse.
      Growing up I received very little guidance and a lot of neglect.
      I didn't know which way was morally right, but I knew their ways were definitely wrong.
      My justifications were my direct and indirect sufferings.
      The greatest evil is causing the unnecessary suffering of others.
      I refused to be that evil to my children, family, friends, neighbors, and fellow members of society.
      Via Negativa (latin for 'the negative way') is a beautifully simplistic idea that
      I owe my life to.

    <h4>Join the Air Force</h4>
    <p>I graduated high school one semester early by attending regular classes from 8:30am-3:30pm and then completing
      self-paced, online courses from 4pm-9pm.
      Early graduation gave me the opportunity to join the United States Air Force at the age of 17. While my friends
      were walking the stage, I was learning
      how to fix multi-million dollar aircraft.

    <h4>Become a Rescue Scuba Diver</h4>
    <p>
      Scuba diving is a popular activity in Okinawa, Japan.
      I was stationed there for three years while on active duty.
      During this time, I got my PADI open water scuba diver certification.
      I found a dive buddy who was equally passionate and we explored every dive site we could find around the island.
      Dive safety is a big concern because such an activity is inherently dangerous.
      I've been to 128 feet of depth with nothing but an air regulator to keep me breathing. That's scary.
      And being so adventurous, my buddy and I often went night diving.
      After realizing the risks first-hand, and hearing stories of other active duty members dying, we decided to
      become NAUI certified rescue scuba divers.
      Going through rigorous rescue dive training gave us more awareness of risks and better decision making skills
      about when to enter the water and what to do while submerged.
      To this day, I've got 92 dives and have only had one safety incident, which I thankfully survived.

    <h4>Run my own business</h4>
    <p>After separating from the Air Force, I decided to try my hand at entrepreneurship by starting a shoe and
      clothing company.
      I found suppliers for sneakers, boots, polo shirts, jeans, shorts, t-shirts, and printing materials. I then
      created my own t-shirt designs with photoshop, printed them,
      and heat-pressed them onto blank t-shirts. My custom-made t-shirts were distributed to independent clothiers
      across Charlotte. The radius of my
      shoe business extended beyond the state borders. People literally went crazy for my sneakers. I sold them in
      front of night clubs, simon malls, and
      sporting events. In the end, I sold over $250K worth of shoes out of the trunk of my car.
      Eventually I liquidated in favor of going to college...but at a nice profit.

    <h4>Attend College</h4>
    <p>I was the first in my family to attend a 4-year university program. At the time of enrollment, I didn't know
      what major I wanted.
      I only knew that I wanted the best return on my investment.
      I asked the admissions counselor what the hardest program was at UNC Charlotte.
      She said it was electrical engineering. I enrolled thinking that if I can do the hardest program they offer, then
      I can everything else by default.
      Surely the hardest degree would pay a decent wage until I figured out what I really wanted to do in life.
      So far the plan has worked.

    <h4>Get an MBA</h4>
    <p>
      Stanford denied me, Duke denied me, Miami accepted me.
      In fact, the University of Miami offered me a 25% scholarship to attend their MBA program.
      After crunching the numbers, I felt the remaining expense of the educational experience was still too high.
      I negotiated the scholarship up to 50% and they accepted.

      The University of Miami offered me $40,000 USD to attend their MBA program.

      I crunched the numbers again, and thought to myself why not just shoot for 100%. I genuinely felt that I deserved
      it.
      I reached back out to the University of Miami and tried to negotiate a 100% scholarship.
      They declined.

      I didn't end up attending their program, but I still consider this a success because I learned some valuable
      lessons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Spanish word for business is negocios. The root of which is the same as negotiation.
        I was embodying business by virtue of this negotiation, and it worked...at least partially.
      </li>
      <li>Make data-driven decisions, but let your intuition be the guide.</li>
      <li>Never be afraid to walk away from a deal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Train Myself for a New Career in Software</h4>
    <p>
      From 2010 to 2013 I worked in the nuclear engineering field.
      I automated robots that processed weapons-grade plutonium, and I designed safety automation systems for nuclear
      reactors - all very politically sexy.
      Theoretically the work was a perfect fit due to my affinity for nuclear physics, but reality proved different.
      The extreme regulatory nature of the industry constantly stunted my ambition and innovative drive.
      I wanted to get out of the industry, but my skills didn't translate to other career opportunities that I found
      interesting, namely software.
      After the Fukushima incident the entire nuclear industry came under scrutiny. Germany pulling out caused a major
      negative shift in public opinion.
      My company lost a lot of work. All of my projects dried up and many engineers were laid off.
      I made a personal commitment to teach myself hard technical skills that would keep me in demand in any given city
      in the world; skills that would
      give me power at my fingertips.
      I went through five levels of management to get a free IDE installed on my desktop at work. I bought an Oracle
      book on Java-based programming and
      taught myself over the next nine weeks. I started at page one and went through every lesson in the book.

      After nine weeks of no work, I finally got laid off. Refusing to go back into the nuclear industry, I submitted
      263 applications for software engineering jobs.
      All of my applications were auto-rejected. "While your qualifications are impressive, we've decided that you're
      not a fit at this time...".

      Eventually I learned how to tailor my resume for the job that I wanted and landed my first software gig.

      Then I branched out to learn C# and Javascript.
      Within my first year as a software engineer, I learned over 18 technologies.
      Since then I've spent thousands of hours studying and practicing the art and science of programming and have more
      than doubled my income.

    <h4>Learn to Fight</h4>
    <p>
      I spent three months training at a professional Muay Thai fight camp in Phuket, Thailand.
      I focused solely on sobriety, flexibility, strength, and hand-to-hand combat skills during this time.
      My training regimen consisted of yoga, muay thai, muay boran, and cross-fit for five hours per day, six days per
      week.
      After three months, I came home.
      My energy and confidence were high, and my life goals were narrowly focused and achievable.
      I felt like a new man.
      Since then, martial arts have become an integral part of my life.
      Seeking more esoteric wisdom, I've begun training Russian Systema.
      Systema has entered my spirit and changed my life in more ways than I could have ever imagined.
      I've learned the goal is not to fight, but to gain self-knowledge and use it to live a fulfilling life.
      We learn through the pain from the strikes we give and take. We learn from healing others through strikes.
      We learn that we can't live a fulfilling life if we are dead. The fight keeps us alive.

    <h4>Teach Myself Artificial Intelligence</h4>
    <p>
      Prior to applying for an MS in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence, I thought it would be a
      good idea to explore
      my aptitude and interest in the subject. I signed up for a four-course Machine Learning specialization via
      Coursera.
      This coursework is taught by two Amazon professors of Machine Learning at the University of Washington. It covers
      foundational use cases,
      linear and logistic regression, and clustering and retrieval. I fell in love with ML.
      Once I completed those courses, I signed up for Andrew NG's Deep Learning specialization.
      This specialization includes five courses on the foundations of deep learning.
      The lectures are very rigorous, the math is hard, and the programming exercises are even more difficult.
      Over the last year and a half, I have spent well over 1000 hours completing nine certifications in Machine
      Learning.

    <h4>Become a Tech Entrepreneur</h4>
    <p>
      I am on the tail end of a 10-year learning curve:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 years - Electical Engineering</li>
      <li>4 years Computer Science</li>
      <li>1.5 years - Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I've reached the absolute edge of technology at this point in time. Though its constantly pushing forward, so am
      I.

      I feel very seasoned at this point in time. I feel confident in leading a software enterprise from a technology
      standpoint.

      I can start from scratch and architect scalable, extensible, modular, and performant web applications.

      Now, its a matter of finding a co-founder with synergy and shared passion.

      I have faith it will all come together.
